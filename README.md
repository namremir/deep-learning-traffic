Machine and Deep Learning to Predict Time through Traffic Circle

Using simulated data for the movement of cars through Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C., we attempt to predict the time through the circle using classical machine learning algorithms (LSR and RF), as well as Artificial Neural Networks and LSTM.
